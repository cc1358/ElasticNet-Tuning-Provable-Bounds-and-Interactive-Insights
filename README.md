# ElasticNet-Tuning-Provable-Bounds-and-Interactive-Insights

a Python-based project that explores advanced regularization techniques for ElasticNet regression. This repository implements and visualizes key theoretical concepts such as sample complexity, online tuning with the EXP3 bandit algorithm, 1/2-dispersion analysis, piecewise decomposable loss structures, and multi-task learning. Built with a focus on provable guarantees, it provides both batch and online methods to tune ElasticNet hyperparameters (λ₁ and λ₂) across multiple problem instances, with optional AIC/BIC adjustments.

The project integrates a Streamlit interface for interactive exploration and includes comprehensive visualizations using Matplotlib. It leverages parallelism with joblib for efficiency and is designed for researchers, data scientists, and machine learning practitioners interested in regularization theory and optimization.
